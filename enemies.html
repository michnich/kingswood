        <p>Neo Periwinkle Cortex, most known as Doctor Neo Cortex, Neo Cortex, N. Cortex, Doctor Cortex or simply Cortex is a
        professional evil scientist born in Peoria, Illinois and the main antagonist of the Crash Bandicoot series. He is known
         as the creator of his nemesis: Crash Bandicoot. In almost all games, Cortex is usually the final boss. </p>

        <p>Tiny Tiger is a Tasmanian tiger initially created by Doctor Nitrus Brio. He is often seen working for Doctor Neo
          Cortex, the main antagonist of the series. Before Crash of the Titans, Tiny was essentially a carbon copy of his
          spiritual predecessor Koala Kong: incredibly powerful and muscular, but overall unintelligent.</p>

        <p>N. Gin is an insane cyborg lackey who stands in for giving assistance to Doctor Neo Cortex when he starts,
          replacing Doctor Nitrus Brio after the events of Crash Bandicoot as his right-hand man. As of Crash: Mind over Mutant,
           he has been replaced (without his knowledge) by the very person he succeeded. </p>
